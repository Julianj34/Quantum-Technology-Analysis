Isotope √ó Quantum Research (2023‚Äì2025)

This repository documents a systematic analysis of isotope-based materials in quantum research.
The focus is on four key isotopes that play a central role in current publications on quantum technologies:

Si-28 (Silicon-28): Spin qubits, donor qubits, quantum dots, transport phenomena
C-12 (Carbon-12): Diamond with NV centers and other color centers, sensing, quantum communication
Yb-171 (Ytterbium-171): Trapped ions and neutral atom arrays
Sr-87 (Strontium-87): Optical lattice clocks and precision time measurement

üîç Methodology

1-Data Source
All research works were collected via the OpenAlex API (an open metadata database for scientific publications).
Time frame: 2023‚Äì2025.
Filtered by relevant topics and search expressions for each isotope.

2-LLM-based Classification
A language model filters publications for relevance (only works with a clear connection to isotopes in quantum technologies).
Assignments to core fields:
NV/diamond
spin qubits (Si)
ion traps
neutral atoms / optical clocks

3-NV-Diamond Subdivision
Since the majority of research falls under C-12 / diamond, these publications were further clustered into subfields:
Sensing (magnetometry, thermometry, etc.)
Quantum information (QIP/QC)
Photonics & communication
Growth / processing / surface engineering
Nanodiamonds & bio-imaging
Other color centers (SiV, GeV, SnV ‚Ä¶)
Theory / simulation

4-Output
CSV files with metadata per isotope, topic, and bucket.
Diagrams (pie charts) showing distributions of isotopes, research fields, and NV-diamond subfields.

üöÄ Goal
The project provides a map of isotope-based quantum research that helps researchers, analysts, and strategists to:
Identify publication trends,
Understand key materials and isotopes,
Spot research gaps and interdisciplinary opportunities.
The analysis is open for extensions ‚Äì both to new isotopes and to additional research areas.
